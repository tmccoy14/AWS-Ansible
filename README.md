[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) is a configuration management tool widely used to provision IT envrionments, deploy software and/or be integrated with CI/CD pipelines. Ansible has an active community where there are lots of Ansible [modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_cloud_modules.html#cloud-modules) for your reference with many different cloud providers.

This repository contains an example of a playbook creating an EC2 Key Pair, EC2 Security Groups, and an EC2 Instance. This could be extremely useful when wanting to automate the creation and configuration of EC2 instances for any number of scenarios. If you're interested in trying out this example for yourself, go check out the [tutorial](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/devops-using-ansible-to-provision-aws-ec2-instances-3d70a1cb155f).
